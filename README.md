Starbucks Capstone Project
This project is a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program by Udacity. The dataset for the project is provided by Starbucks Corporation.

Project Overview
In this project, we analyze an offer strategy by Starbucks. When Starbucks sends an offer to users of the mobile app, some users might receive the offer, view the offer, and then complete the offer. Others might receive the offer but ignore it. The goal of this project is to predict whether a user would respond to an offer or not, based on demographic data and offer details.

Files
Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
data/: Directory containing the data for the project. It includes the following files:
portfolio.json: containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json: demographic data for each customer
transcript.json: records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
Installation
The code uses Python 3.7.6, along with Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries are needed:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Imbalanced-learn
Results
Our refined model successfully predicts whether a user would respond to an offer or not with an accuracy of X% (replace X with the actual value). For more details about the performance of the model, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Starbucks for providing this dataset and Udacity for providing the opportunity to work on this project.
